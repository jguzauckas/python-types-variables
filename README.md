The following files contain sample code to help you understand the concepts:

I have created the classwork.py file for you to complete as classwork, demonstrating knowledge from the above files. The classwork.txt file shows you what your output should look like for classwork.py.
To get help or more thoroughly check your own answers, check out the classworkcompleted.py file, which has the same requirements completed.
