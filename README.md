This repository has select sample Python code to help you understand the basic types of variables and their select operations.

Each component has two files with similar names. One is a markdown file (`.md`) and the other is a Python file (`.py`).

The markdown file has formatted notes describing concepts and talking about sample code. All of the sample code snippets are found in the Python file for you to be able to run, and modify.

The recommended order for information is:

1. basic types
2. number operations
3. boolean operations
4. string operations

Once you've gone through those notes and code samples, try the classwork.py file, which offers some problems for you to program a solution for!

To check your "answers", check out the classwork.txt file which is a sample output for the classwork file based on my own solution, which is also provided in classworkcompleted.py.

Finally, give homework.py a try with some additional problems!
