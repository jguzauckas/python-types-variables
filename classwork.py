#This Python file needs to be completed so that the output matches what is written
#in classwork.txt

#Here is a sample:
a = 5
b = 10
print(a + b) #Note that this just prints the sum, that's okay!

#First, define variables with the values 16, 35, 13.2, 23.6, True, False, "Hello", "World"


#Next lets do some operations. Using print, your variables, and your operations, do
#16 + 35, 35 - 13.2, 13.2 * 23.6, 23.6 / 16, 35 // 16, 16 ** 13.2


#not True, True and False, True or False


#The length of "Hello", the third character of "World", from beginning to 4 of "Hello"
#from 2 to end of "World", from 2 to 5 of "Hello"
